# Caffeinated Sodas

A mod for The Long Dark, which gives sodas a fatigue reduction buff. Since sodas often contain caffeine and are high in sugar they're bound to give you at least a little kick, right?

By default orange soda gives the strongest buff, and the summit soda gives the weakest.

The strength and duration of the buff can be customized for each soda item, within reason.

# Installation

- Install [Mod Settings](https://github.com/DigitalzombieTLD/ModSettings/releases/), it is required.
- Drop the .dll file into your mods folder.
